# Description of the data and data source:

The datasets were retrieved from [BUREAU OF TRANSPORTATION STATISTICS](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/).

The following lists the technologies used for this project:

## Tools:
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Jupyter Notebook

## Database:
    - 
    -
    
## Machine Learning:
    Scikit-learn
    TensorFlow

## Analysis:
    Matplotlib, Plotly
    Google Slides
    Tableau

# Segment 1: Analysis

## Questions we hope to answer with the data:

- Major Reason for flight Delays
- Delays due to weather
- Average Flight Delays (minutes) by Airline Carrier
- Flight Delays counts by Airline Carrier
- Which days has most flight delays
- Likelihood of flight delays in upcoming days

## Description of the data exploration phase of the project:


## Description of data preprocessing:

 To preprocess the data for use in the machine learning models, we completed the following steps:

    1. Selected desired columns from the database
    2. Use the fill na function to replace any NaN values with 0
    3. Convert the date column to DateTime datatype
